# Using the bot code
This bot was not made with the intent for other build teams to use but if you can read my source code and use Pterodactyl 
it is doable. You will need to self host it but since you use Pterodactyl you will be able to host it alongside your Minecraft server.
If there's enough interest in using it then I may make notes on what needs to be changed within the code and other steps to use it yourself.
